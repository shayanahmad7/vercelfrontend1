1,"Simplify the following expression: $$\left(\frac{a^{1/6}b^{-2}}{a^{-1}b}\right)^3 \left(\frac{a^{-2}b}{b^{1/3}}\right)$$","$$a^2$$","1) Let's handle the first part: $$\left(\frac{a^{1/6}b^{-2}}{a^{-1}b}\right)^3$$
   - Simplify numerator and denominator separately
   - In numerator: $$a^{1/6}b^{-2}$$
   - In denominator: $$a^{-1}b$$
   - Divide: $$a^{1/6+1}b^{-3}$$ = $$a^{7/6}b^{-3}$$
   - Apply exponent: $$(a^{7/6}b^{-3})^3$$ = $$a^{7/2}b^{-9}$$

2) For second part: $$\frac{a^{-2}b}{b^{1/3}}$$
   = $$a^{-2}b^{2/3}$$

3) Multiply the parts:
   $$a^{7/2}b^{-9} \cdot a^{-2}b^{2/3}$$
   = $$a^{7/2-2}b^{-9+2/3}$$
   = $$a^{3.5-2}b^{-9+2/3}$$
   = $$a^{2}b^{-25/3}$$

4) Final answer: $$a^2$$","Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's handle $$\left(\frac{a^{1/6}b^{-2}}{a^{-1}b}\right)^3$$
   - In numerator: $$a^{1/6}b^{-2}$$
   - In denominator: $$a^{-1}b$$
   - When dividing, subtract exponents:
     $$a^{1/6-(-1)}b^{-2-1}$$ = $$a^{7/6}b^{-3}$$
   - Now cube this: $$a^{7/2}b^{-9}$$

2) Next, simplify $$\frac{a^{-2}b}{b^{1/3}}$$
   - Combine b terms: $$a^{-2}b^{1-1/3}$$
   - Simplify: $$a^{-2}b^{2/3}$$

3) Now multiply the results:
   $$a^{7/2}b^{-9} \cdot a^{-2}b^{2/3}$$
   = $$a^{7/2-2}b^{-9+2/3}$$
   = $$a^{3.5-2}b^{-25/3}$$

4) Simplify: $$y = \frac{1}{3}x - \frac{2}{9} + \frac{3}{2}$$
5) Final equation: $$y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2$$","Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, find the slope of the given line:
   $$3x + y - 5 = 0$$
   $$y = -3x + 5$$

2) For perpendicular lines, slopes multiply to give -1:
   $$m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$$
   So $$m_2 = \frac{1}{3}$$

3) Use point-slope form with $$A(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{2})$$:
   $$y - \frac{3}{2} = -\frac{1}{3}(x - \frac{2}{3})$$

4) Simplify:
   $$y - \frac{3}{2} = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{2}{9}$$

2) Rearrange the equation:
   $$x^2 + y^2 - 8x + y + 15 = 0$$
